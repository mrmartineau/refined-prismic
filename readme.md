Clone this repo, install dependencies and run `yarn build`

## Customization

We're happy to receive suggestions and contributions, but be aware this is a highly opinionated project. There's a very high bar for adding options. Users will always disagree with something. That being said, we're open to discussing things. If something doesn't make the cut, you can [build your customized Refined Prismic locally](https://prismic.com/mrmartineau/refined-prismic/blob/master/contributing.md#workflow), rather than installing it from the Chrome Store.
